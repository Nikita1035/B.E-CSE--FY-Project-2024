# Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning 🌱

## 📌 Overview
Crop Disease Detection using Machine Learning is a web-based application that detects crop diseases from leaf images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system helps farmers identify diseases at an early stage and provides **preventive measures**, reducing crop loss and improving agricultural productivity.

The project uses image preprocessing, data augmentation, and deep learning techniques to classify healthy and diseased crops accurately.

## ▶️ How It Works
1. Admin registers crops, diseases, and uploads images  
2. Images are preprocessed and stored  
3. CNN model is trained using augmented data  
4. User uploads crop image  
5. System predicts disease and suggests remedies  

---

## 📈 Results
- Accurate detection of crop diseases using CNN
- Faster prediction compared to manual inspection
- Improved reliability with image augmentation

---

## 🌍 Social Impact
- Helps farmers detect diseases early
- Reduces crop loss and pesticide misuse
- Supports sustainable and precision agriculture

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Mobile application support
- Multi-crop and multi-language support
- Real-time field image detection
- Integration with IoT sensors
